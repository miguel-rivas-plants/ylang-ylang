          <p>I've been working with tools like Github, Jade/Haml, Sass/Less And PHP/Ruby. I hope my portfolio can get your attention, since i'm really interested in learning more from Westwing.</p>
          <p>In the bottom i attached my portfolio, codepend account, linkedin profile and e-mail.</p>

            <h3>DrLogic</h3>
            <div class="scrollContent">
              <p>This was the second project that i worked at Pixel Perfect Tree. When it was giving to me it was an empty frontend with the provided design and a defined <em>.env.sample</em> with a basic configuration of the ports, <em>gitignored</em>, ruby version and some initial gems like <em>haml-rails</em> and <em>autoprefixer</em>.</p>
              <p>I install the missing gems for <em>bootstrap</em>, <em>rail-sass</em> and proposed to the lead developer a new way to defined metadata for every project. i wasn't sure how to do that in my second project in ruby on rails but i had an idea because i made something similar in <em>Jade</em> for my portfolio and in <em>PHP</em> for Cerveza Presidente. the specifications were a function which gets all the parameters that metadata will need:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Page details</li>
                <li>Page title</li>
                <li>Keys for SEO</li>
                <li>Icons in differents resolutions</li>
                <li>URL for Open Graph image (Facebook Preview)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We agree and started an investigation for that issue them began to deploy a function similar but the parameters were in the translation file (something that was new for me but really handy). After that the project was ready to begin.</p>
              <p>There were a few things missing in the design that i made and them implemented:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Page 404</li>
                <li>Facebook Preview</li>
                <li>Loading</li>

            <h3>Evolution of the Web</h3>
            <div class="scrollContent">
              <p>This project was a research about basic info of the web, so the user in the end of the lecture can have a nice conversation of multiples topic with people of the area or RRHH. It was something like a community project.</p>
              <p>At first it was supossed to be a book to be publish in Issuu but i was talking about the web, a book that talk about the web is not that cool as a webpage that talk about the web. this was the first of his kind in my portfolio.</p>

            <div class="scrollContent">
              <p>This was the first big project that i worked without Backend Developer at Capital DBG.</p>
              <p>When it was giving to me it was just the provided design, I build the project them the optimization began.</p>
              <p>The specifications were made the website the fastest that it could because there was a lot of content. I resize all the images to the minimum width/height them optimized and made an special typography with all the icons needed.</p>
              <p>After that i made individual loaders for every section and organize the info in a way that you will get the firsts sections at the begining then the galley start loading. this way you would see basic content at first while the gallery load.</p>
              <p>Things that were missing in the design that i made and them implemented:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Facebook Preview</li>
