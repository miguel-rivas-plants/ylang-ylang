		p hi!

		p I am <em>Miguel Rivas</em> a Frontend Developer who lives in Santo Domingo and I'm looking forward to join your team. I've been working for a while developing websites for top brands as Cerveza Presidente.

		p It has been a really good journey but right now i'll like to expand my knowledge and explore the best practices around the world.

		p I've been working with tools like Github, Jade/Haml, Sass/Less And PHP/Ruby. I hope my portfolio can get your attention, since i'm really interested in learning more from Westwing.
