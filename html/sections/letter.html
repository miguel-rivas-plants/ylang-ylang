    <h2>hi!</h2>
    <p>I am a Frontend Developer who lives in Santo Domingo and I'm looking forward to join your team. I've been working for a while developing websites with CSS animations for top brands as Cerveza Presidente.</p>
    <p>It has been a really good journey but right now i'll like to expand my knowledge and explore the best practices around the world.</p>
    <p>I've been working with tools like Github, Jade/Haml, Sass/Less And PHP/Ruby. I hope my portfolio can get your attention, since i'm really interested in learning more from Culture Amp.</p>
    <p>In the bottom i attached my portfolio, codepend account, linkedin profile and e-mail.</p>
    <p>I'm really looking forward to hear from you. <em>:)</em></p>
